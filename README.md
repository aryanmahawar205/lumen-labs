# Lumen-Labs

## Description
Lumen-Labs is an image processing project focused on color space conversions, basic image statistics, and pixel manipulation techniques. This project provides a foundation for exploring core concepts in image processing, making it perfect for experimenting with visual data transformations and pixel operations.

## Features
- Convert between different color spaces (RGB, HSV, etc.). <br>
- Extract and analyze basic image statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.). <br>
- Perform pixel-level transformations and modifications. <br>
- Modular code to expand and experiment with additional image processing techniques. <br>
